# Covid19TrendsZA

## Introduction

This is a Covid-19 analytics dashboard for South Africa.

This project was inspired by analytics on USA data, [Rt.live](https://rt.live). The South African model was refined by the [Data Science for Social Impact research group](https://github.com/dsfsi/covid19za/blob/master/notebooks/Realtime%20R0.ipynb) (DFSI).

The dashboard is build with Django. The analytics engine currently runs on the [DFSI](https://github.com/dsfsi/covid19za) repo.
